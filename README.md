# MR Direct Position Test

## One
##### PHP
I'm familiar with Laravel (I'm still struggling with the model aspect of MVC). I've used multiple php template frameworks, currently I use Smarty for . I've used Twilio in the past but it was so long ago. I'm not sure if wordpress counts as a framework, but I've managed to set up a couple different sites using it. Nothing too complex. Once I get free time I'd like to explore composer more. I'm a huge fan of the autoloader, I'm just not 100% sure how it works.

##### JS
I've played around with react and had a good experience with it. I have a repo of a project used for an Owens Corning internship test on my github. 


## Two
Without googling, I think its the position of the parent. So an element within the body will use the browser window.

... I tested it and I think it goes off of the first relatively positioned parent. 


## Three
This was my first time using a lot of the css properties. I think I could make it more mobile friendly using a % width for the square and changing the pixels to % based. I couldn't find out how to traverse the container or do the rotation without doing the percentages.

## Four
* I got really close with four using the css grid and no border. To set the internal grid lines I used a background color of black on the grid container and the grid row and column gaps to 2px. I liked using CSS grid because it was the simplest solution. But it wasn't fully functional.
* The second method I used table selectors and first and last child properties on the trs and tds. This worked just as well, but it wasn' the exact output you guys were looking for
* The last I had to fully hack the solution together. I used a helper classes to remove sections of borders and a helper function to choose which classes to use. Slightly ugly but it works.

MR Direct Position Test

#1
### PHP
I'm familiar with Laravel (I'm still struggling with the model aspect of MVC). I've used multiple php template frameworks, currently I use Smarty for . I've used Twilio in the past but it was so long ago. 

### JS
I've played around with react and had a good experience with it. I have a repo of a project used for an Owens Corning internship test on my github. 


#2
Without googling, I think its the position of the parent. So an element within the body will use the browser window.
